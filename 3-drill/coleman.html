                <p>The parks are all over a large piece of land, so there are plenty of transportation services that can be used to get from one park to another. The resorts can also be seen on the map if you want to see how far away certain hotels are from each resort. Many people like to stay close to Magic Kingdom due to the firework show at the end of the night. </p>
