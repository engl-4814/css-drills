      <h1>Knitting Machine Logistics</h1>
      <p>
        Knitting machines became popular in the 1920's. In the 1930's they also became available commerically and changed the market of knit garments. They made knit clothing much faster to produce, and therefore much cheaper to the consumer. Through the rest of the century consumer knitting machines were produced and, while they were expensive, the demand was sufficient. They have since stopped producing and selling commercial machines, and the market depends on the selling of used vintage machines.
