# Practice Organizing & Sizing with Different Values

1. Please review the HTML and CSS code in your editor and browser's inspector. 
   - My comments in the `lindgren.css` file build on the readings by providing some explanations about what it's doing. 
   - I also prompt you to change values and research rule declarations. Be sure to do so.
2. Once you have a sense of what a typography scheme is from this example, write your own HTML page and CSS files that creates your own typography and simple design scheme. Be sure to practice the following:
   - Organizing your CSS in logical sections
   - Along with a typography scheme, define a simple color scheme. Check out some color pallettes online: [coolers.co](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) 
   - Practice using the custom CSS variables within your scheme.
3. Use the same pattern of using your lastname for the file names.

**NOTE**: I do not mind if you work together with anyone, but you should not write the same code together. Help each other instead.

**DO NOT** push your code until class time.
