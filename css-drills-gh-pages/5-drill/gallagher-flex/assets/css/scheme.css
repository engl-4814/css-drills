/* 
## 2. Flexing Reusable Classes to Create a Design Scheme

Spot the design pattern in the wireframe below, and recreate it with flexbox:

<img style="width:80%"
     src="../images/flex-2-row-scheme.png"
     alt="Wireframe offered as an alignment design practice drill using flexbox." />

Like drill #1, there are variations on this design scheme, but try to write your 
HTML and CSS in a way that balances the amount of code necessary to write it, 
as well as code that is **reusable as possible classes** to reuse across a larger site.
