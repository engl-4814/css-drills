                Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients that has been frozen into a soft, creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only become commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to a number of ice-cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.

                The origins of frozen desserts are obscure although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources describe ice cream-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BCE[4][5] while others claim that the Roman Emperor Nero had ice collected from the Apennine Mountains to produce the first sorbet mixed with honey and wine, although sorbet is nowadays believed have been invented in Persia.[6][7][8][9][10] Other accounts say ice cream originated in the Mongol Empire and first spread to China during its expansion.[11]
