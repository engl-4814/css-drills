# Enter the Grid: 2-Dimensional Alignment Skills with ```display: grid;```

## Folder Setup

Follow this procedure to setup your coding folder:

1. Within this root folder, create a new folder with the name: `lastname-grid`.
   - **NOTE** `lastname` is your last name. Mine would be: `lindgren-grid`.
2. Inside the root of *your personal coding folder*, create the an HTMl file named `grids.html`.
3. Again, inside the root of *your personal coding folder*, create an `assets` folder.
4. Inside `assets`, create a `.keep` file and a `css` folder.
5. Inside `css`, create `grids.css` to link to `grids.html`.
6. `※\(^o^)/※` Start writing some code! `※\(^o^)/※`

## Goal

Practice different design and grid techniques from the readings / videos.

1. Design a grid as a wireframe
2. Code it using the following grid techniques:
   - `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` that use whatever mix of the following values for your grid: `fr`, `min-content`, `max-content`, and fixed values (`px`).
3. Be sure to practice using HTML5 elements, where you can and should do so.
4. Be sure to include your wireframe as a file in your assets folder.


## Other Considerations

- Practice designing these sites with the **MOZILLA FIREFOX** browser's inspection tool. It has a more robust inspector than Chrome. However, Chrome now has a flex and grid inspectioon tool, if you have a more recent version.
- If you'd like to spice it up with your  own flare, feel free to practice some basic typography and color schemes. 
- You can also use your own images, instead of placeholders. BUT, be sure to create your own images folder in your project, and be mindful of the file sizes, since others will fetch these files too.
- Practice documenting your code and writing your CSS from more general rules to more specific in the HTML source order.
- **NOTE**: I do not mind if you work together with anyone, but you should not write the same code together. Help each other instead.
- **DO NOT** push your code until class time.
- Be sure to submit the assignment link in Canvas.
