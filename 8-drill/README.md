# Drill #8: Team Layouts

In small teams, do the following for next Tuesday's class:

1. Choose between the following 2 websites to recreate with grid and flexbox:
   1. Easier: [https://psikontacto.com/](https://psijust kontacto.com/).
   2. More challenging: [https://www.vermont.eu/](https://www.vermont.eu/).
2. Sketch a desktop-size wireframe by abstracting the generic layout patterns per content area. 
3. Annotate the layout with HTML and CSS layout applications.
4. Practice writing accessible HTML5 elements with a simple typography and color scheme.

Feel free to gloss over design elements that seem a little out of your capability. Focus more on the fidelity of the overall layout scheme with the basic elements. Yet, this is another opportunity to push ourselves forward, so feel free to practice some more advanced flexible techniques, if you feel up to it.

Be sure to include your *annotated* wireframe as a file in your assets folder.

## Communication

- Communicate with your team about when you will work on the project across the week into next Tuesday.
- If you push some code to further the project along, use the comment feature on Github to also tag them on a message that communicates what you did and what needs to be done next.

## Folder Setup

Follow this procedure to setup your coding folder:

1. Within this root folder, create a new folder with the name of your team: `teamname-layout`.
   - **NOTE** `teamname` is your team's made-up name, e.g., `griddyup-grid`. ;-)
2. Inside the root of *your team's coding folder*, create an `.html` file named however you'd like.
3. Again, inside the root of *your team's coding folder*, create an `assets` folder.
4. Inside `assets`, create a `.keep` file and a `css` folder.
5. Inside `css`, create your `.css` files, as needed, which link to your respective `.html` files.
6. `※\(^o^)/※` Start writing some code! `※\(^o^)/※`


## Other Considerations

- Practice designing these sites with the **MOZILLA FIREFOX** browser's inspection tool. It has a more robust inspector than Chrome. However, Chrome now has a flex and grid inspectioon tool, if you have a more recent version.
- You can also use your own images, instead of placeholders. BUT, be sure to create your own images folder in your project, and be mindful of the file sizes, since others will fetch these files too.
- Practice documenting your code and writing your CSS from more general rules to more specific in the HTML source order.
- Be sure to submit the assignment link in Canvas.
