# Demo of grid areas with mobile-first @media queries and breakpoints

This drill is to help practice analyzing existing code. Review this code and page in **Firefox** with your group by answering the following questions:

1. How many grid areas are defined and applied in this case?
2. Why this many, and how and where are they defined?
3. How do the media queries work?
4. What do you notice about the way the CSS organized and written?
5. If you have time, test the page breakpoints in Chrome now. What differences do you notice about when it breaks into the mobile-first grid-area ruleset?
