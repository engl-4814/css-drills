                <p>There are many things to do in downtown San Antonio, Texas. One of the major tourist spots is the location of the Alamo where you can tour a museum which is the location of where it took place. Then you can go along their famous river walk for a drink or a bite to eat.</p>

                <h2 class="eat">Where to Eat:</h3>
                <p> There are many places to eat on the River Walk in Downtown San Antonio. One of the best places to eat is PizzaRitas where they have pizza and margaritas that you can take with you on your walk around the river. </p>

                <h2 class="stay">Places to Stay:</h2>
                <p> I would recommend staying somewhere on the River Walk. This is because there are so many places that you can walk to from there. This will make it easier to get to restaurants at night and then you will have a short walk home. One of the main hotels is the Hyatt Hotel which is in the middle of the river walk. </p>

                <h2 class="tips">Extra tips:</h2>
                <p>Be careful because there are many homeless people. I would stay away from poorly lit areas downtown because they may not be safe. Be aware of your surroundings at night especially.</p>
