# Return of the Grid: Grinding Your Multi-Dimensional Alignment Skills with ```grid``` && ```flex```

You've gotten some practice with both grid and flexbox. Now, cast your gaze upon the world around for inspiration. Now, create 2 new layouts: 
1. Create the wireframe that you worked on in class.
2. Find another layout in the wild that brings you joy and recreate it with grid and flexbox.

Be sure to balance the challenge with your comfort level. I want us all to push ourselves forward in this one, so we can practice some more advanced flexible techniques over the last coming weeks.

## Folder Setup

Follow this procedure to setup your coding folder:

1. Within this root folder, create a new folder with the name: `lastname-grid`.
   - **NOTE** `lastname` is your last name. Mine would be: `lindgren-grid`.
2. Inside the root of *your personal coding folder*, create 2 `.html` files named however you'd like.
3. Again, inside the root of *your personal coding folder*, create an `assets` folder.
4. Inside `assets`, create a `.keep` file and a `css` folder.
5. Inside `css`, create 2 `.css` files, which link to your respective `.html` files.
6. `※\(^o^)/※` Start writing some code! `※\(^o^)/※`

## Goal

Practice different design and grid techniques from the readings / videos.

1. Code your 2 layouts using any of the grid techniques that we have reviewed in class. Youo can also consider branching out, if you so desire.
2. **Be sure to practice using HTML5 elements**, where you can and should do so. Do no create a ```div`` inception.
3. Be sure to include your wireframe as a file in your assets folder.


## Other Considerations

- Practice designing these sites with the **MOZILLA FIREFOX** browser's inspection tool. It has a more robust inspector than Chrome. However, Chrome now has a flex and grid inspectioon tool, if you have a more recent version.
- If you'd like to spice it up with your  own flare, feel free to practice some basic typography and color schemes. 
- You can also use your own images, instead of placeholders. BUT, be sure to create your own images folder in your project, and be mindful of the file sizes, since others will fetch these files too.
- Practice documenting your code and writing your CSS from more general rules to more specific in the HTML source order.
- **NOTE**: I do not mind if you work together with anyone, but you should not write the same code together. Help each other instead.
- **DO NOT** push your code until class time.
- Be sure to submit the assignment link in Canvas.
