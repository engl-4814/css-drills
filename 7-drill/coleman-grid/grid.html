            <h2>Movies from Books</h2>
            <p>There are so many popular movies based on books. Each book has been written by a famous artist and then transformed so that they can be seen in the movie theaters. Here is a list of some books and book series that resulted in amazing movies.</p>
            <ul class="books">
                <li>Harry Potter (series)</li>
                <li>The Notebook</li>
                <li>The Hunger Games (series)</li>
                <li>Little Women</li>
                <li>Gone Girl</li>
                <li>The Great Gatsby</li>
                <li>Perks of Being a Wallflower</li>
                <li>Safe Haven</li>
                <li>The Secret Life of Bees</li>
                <li>Forrest Gump</li>
            </ul>
            <p> One of my favorite books turned into a movie is The Great Gatsby. I love what the producers did to turn the bring about the lift of Gatsby. They really created an amazing story and used great backgrounds and props to develop his fancy life.</p>
            <p>My favorite series ever is the Harry Potter Series. The way that J.K. Rowling developed a series that excites people and makes them want to join in is amazing. They have created theme parks after these books so you know that they are amazing.</p>
